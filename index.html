<p>The world's largest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef, has lost half of its coral since 2016.  Over the last two years, the coral has undergone two separate bleaching events which have killed an estimated 50% of the coral.  These bleaching events can be caused by a change in water temperature of as much as 2 degrees Fahrenheit.  This slight temperature can stress the coral enough to the point where they expel the algae that lives on them, leaving them colorless in the absence of the vibrant algae.</p>  
<p>The absence of the algae slowly starves the coral over time.  The decay of the coral can happen quickly after it has been separated from the algae.  In a nine-month span in 2016, over one third of the coral in the great reef died.</p>

<p style="font-size:30px">The Great Barrier Reef has always been the most protected coral reefs in the world and was considered to be very stable, however the drastic effects on the reef caused by the rise of ocean temperatures has been too much for the reef to handle.  Even if the coral can survive and rebound, the reef likely will not be the same as it was before.  Most of the coral that has died is decades old and would likely take decades to grow back to its original size and scale.</p>

<h1>What We Can Do</h1>
<p>Listed at the top of this page are different organizations that are fighting to save the reef through donations and political action.  These organizations support clean energy laws and regulations that protect the reef from drilling, fishing, human interference, and climate change.
